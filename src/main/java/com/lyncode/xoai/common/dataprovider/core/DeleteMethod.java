/**
 * If a record is no longer available then it is considered to be deleted. Repositories must declare one of three levels of support for deleted records in the deletedRecord element of the Identify response:
 *
 * no - the repository does not maintain information about deletions. A repository that indicates this level of support must not reveal a deleted status in any response.
 * persistent - the repository maintains information about deletions without a time limit. A repository that indicates this level of support must persistently keep track of the full history of deletions and consistently reveal the status of a deleted record over time.
 * transient - the repository does not guarantee that a list of deletions is maintained persistently or consistently. A repository that indicates this level of support may reveal a deleted status for records.
 *
 * If a repository does not keep track of deletions then such records will simply vanish from responses and there will be no way for a harvester to discover deletions through continued incremental harvesting. If a repository does keep track of deletions then the datestamp of the deleted record must be the date and time that it was deleted. Responses to GetRecord request for a deleted record must then include a header with the attribute status="deleted", and must not include metadata or about parts. Similarly, responses to selective harvesting requests with set membership and date range criteria that include deleted records must include the headers of these records. Incremental harvesting will thus discover deletions from repositories that keep track of them.

 * Deleted status is a property of individual records. Like a normal record, a deleted record is identified by a unique identifier, a metadataPrefix and a datestamp. Other records, with different metadataPrefix but the same unique identifier, may remain available for the item.
