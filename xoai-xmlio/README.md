Forked from https://github.com/lyncode/xml-io, licensed under Apache 2.0, last release to Maven Central was 2014.
This library is used to wrap around Java XML libraries like StAX etc to extract XML data from streams and events.

It has been altered

- to avoid collisions with others and 
- as it hasn't been changed for a long time and 
- uses stable native Java APIs and
- isn't currently used by any other (public) project, 

has been drawn into this complete XOAI package as a submodule.
